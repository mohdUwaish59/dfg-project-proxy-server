# System Documentation Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive system documentation for the oTree Proxy Server. The documentation should be accessible to non-technical users, including researchers, administrators, and participants who need to understand how the system works, how to use it, and what to expect during the experiment process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Overview Documentation

**User Story:** As a non-technical user, I want a clear overview of what the oTree Proxy Server does, so that I can understand its purpose and benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the overview THEN the system SHALL explain the proxy server's main purpose in simple terms
2. WHEN a user reads the overview THEN the system SHALL describe the key benefits of using the proxy server
3. WHEN a user reads the overview THEN the system SHALL include a high-level system architecture diagram
4. WHEN a user reads the overview THEN the system SHALL explain the difference between direct oTree access and proxy server access

### Requirement 2: User Role Documentation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand the different roles in the system, so that I know what functionality is available to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the role documentation THEN the system SHALL describe the Administrator role and its capabilities
2. WHEN a user reads the role documentation THEN the system SHALL describe the Participant role and their experience
3. WHEN a user reads the role documentation THEN the system SHALL include screenshots of each role's interface
4. WHEN a user reads the role documentation THEN the system SHALL explain the permissions and limitations of each role

### Requirement 3: Administrator Workflow Documentation

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator reads the workflow documentation THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step login instructions with screenshots
2. WHEN an administrator reads the workflow documentation THEN the system SHALL explain how to create new experiment links with form field descriptions
3. WHEN an administrator reads the workflow documentation THEN the system SHALL describe how to monitor experiment progress in real-time
4. WHEN an administrator reads the workflow documentation THEN the system SHALL explain how to manage and deactivate links
5. WHEN an administrator reads the workflow documentation THEN the system SHALL include troubleshooting common issues

### Requirement 4: Participant Experience Documentation

**User Story:** As a participant, I want to understand what will happen when I click an experiment link, so that I know what to expect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a participant reads the experience documentation THEN the system SHALL explain the waiting room concept and purpose
2. WHEN a participant reads the experience documentation THEN the system SHALL describe what happens when they join an experiment
3. WHEN a participant reads the experience documentation THEN the system SHALL show screenshots of the waiting room interface
4. WHEN a participant reads the experience documentation THEN the system SHALL explain the group formation process
5. WHEN a participant reads the experience documentation THEN the system SHALL describe what happens when the group is complete

### Requirement 5: Technical Flow Documentation

**User Story:** As a technical stakeholder, I want detailed flowcharts and diagrams, so that I can understand the system's technical workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the technical flow documentation THEN the system SHALL include a participant journey flowchart
2. WHEN a user reads the technical flow documentation THEN the system SHALL include an administrator workflow diagram
3. WHEN a user reads the technical flow documentation THEN the system SHALL show database interaction patterns
4. WHEN a user reads the technical flow documentation THEN the system SHALL include error handling flow diagrams
5. WHEN a user reads the technical flow documentation THEN the system SHALL use Mermaid diagrams for technical flows

### Requirement 6: Feature Documentation

**User Story:** As a user, I want detailed explanations of all system features, so that I can make full use of the system's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the feature documentation THEN the system SHALL explain the real-time participant tracking feature
2. WHEN a user reads the feature documentation THEN the system SHALL describe the category and treatment classification system
3. WHEN a user reads the feature documentation THEN the system SHALL explain the automatic group formation and redirection
4. WHEN a user reads the feature documentation THEN the system SHALL describe the browser fingerprinting for participant identification
5. WHEN a user reads the feature documentation THEN the system SHALL explain the progress monitoring and statistics features

### Requirement 7: Screenshot and Visual Documentation

**User Story:** As a visual learner, I want screenshots and diagrams throughout the documentation, so that I can better understand the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the documentation THEN the system SHALL include placeholder sections for screenshots of all major interfaces
2. WHEN a user views the documentation THEN the system SHALL include captions explaining what each screenshot shows
3. WHEN a user views the documentation THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting for all visual elements
4. WHEN a user views the documentation THEN the system SHALL include before/after screenshots for workflow steps
5. WHEN a user views the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide alternative text descriptions for accessibility

### Requirement 8: Troubleshooting and FAQ Documentation

**User Story:** As a user encountering issues, I want troubleshooting guides and FAQs, so that I can resolve problems independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the troubleshooting documentation THEN the system SHALL include common error messages and their solutions
2. WHEN a user reads the troubleshooting documentation THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step problem resolution guides
3. WHEN a user reads the troubleshooting documentation THEN the system SHALL include FAQ sections for both administrators and participants
4. WHEN a user reads the troubleshooting documentation THEN the system SHALL explain when to contact technical support
5. WHEN a user reads the troubleshooting documentation THEN the system SHALL include screenshots of error states and their resolutions
